## Results

Global, regional, and national estimates of lifespan inequality (LI) and healthy lifespan inequality (HLI) for the period 1990−2019, and the corresponding 80% uncertainty intervals, are available on 'EstimatesHLI-LI-1990-2019.csv'. This file has the following variables/columns:
* location_id: Location number assigned by GBD
* location_name: Name of the location
* ISO3: Three-letter country codes (only for countries/territories)
* Type: Whether the location is a super-region, super-region/region, region, or country/territory
* SuperRegion: Super-region at which a region or country/territory belong
* Region: Region at which a country/territory belongs
* Year: 1990−2019
* Sex: Female, male, or both sexes combined
* Age: 0 for estimates that refer to all ages, and 65 for estimates that refer to ages above 65 years
* Measure: ‘Mortality’ for estimates of lifespan inequality, and ‘Morbidity’ for estimates of healthy lifespan inequality
* ex: Corresponding values of life expectancy or HALE reported by GBD
* SD: Estimated level of lifespan inequality/healthy lifespan inequality, measured as the standard deviation of the corresponding age-at-death/age-at-morbidity onset distribution
* SDlow10: Lower bound (10% percentile) of the estimated standard deviation of the corresponding age-at-death/age-at-morbidity onset distribution
* SDup90: Upper bound (90% percentile) of the estimated standard deviation of the corresponding age-at-death/age-at-morbidity onset distribution

Global, regional, and national estimates of the ratio between healthy lifespan inequality and lifespan inequality (HLI/LI) for the period 1990−2019, and the corresponding 80% uncertainty intervals, are available on 'RatiosHLI-LI-1990-2019.csv'.
