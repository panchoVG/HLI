# Healthy lifespan inequality: morbidity compression from a global perspective
Supporting information for HEALTHY LIFESPAN INEQUALITY: MORBIDITY COMPRESSION FROM A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE by Iñaki PERMANYER, Francisco VILLAVICENCIO, and Sergi TRIAS-LLIMÓS.

This repository contains the following files and folders:
 
* CalcHLI.R: R code to reconstruct mortality and morbidity life tables and compute lifespan and healthy lifespan inequality measures. Any user should be able to run the code in R or RStudio, with no need to manipulate the file, but installing/uploading all the necessary libraries.
* Functions.R: File with all the necessary functions to reproduce the results from the paper. The file is sourced by CalcHLI.R and does not need to be executed by the user.
* Figures.R: R code to replicate the Table and Figures from the manuscript, and recover the estimates reported in the text.
* GBD2019: Folder with all the input data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2019 used.
* Results: Folder with CSV data files reporting global, regional, and national estimates of lifespan inequality (LI) and healthy lifespan inequality (HLI) measures, and HLI/LI ratios, 1990–2019.
